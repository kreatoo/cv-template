You can also look at the [Full CV PDF](https://github.com/kreatoo/cv-template/releases/download/v2/cv.pdf) if you want.


## Features
* Completely automated using GitHub Actions
* Reproducible using Nix
* Easy to use
* Automated age changing because I'm lazy
* PDF release for every commit

## Getting started
You need to have Nix installed, please see [nix.dev](https://nix.dev) for that.

If you don't have Nix installed you can also use GitHub Actions to build the PDF's as it creates a release for every commit.

After that you can run `build.sh` and if you haven't made any mistakes you should be good to go!
